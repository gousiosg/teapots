Triangles
=========

# Prerequisites

* The Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC)
* The Gloss graphics library
* Python 3 (Tested only on 3.2)
* sh-compatible shell (Sorry windows users)
* The Gloss library
* GLUT (necessary for Gloss)

# Compilation

Just run ./compile.sh. 
It will first generate a necessary haskell source file
(RawTriangleData.hs), then compile the system.

# Running the program

Just run ./run.sh.
Alternatively, ./Visualizatuon can be run, but that will only be
available after compilation.

# Cleanup

Just run ./clean.sh.
This will remove all generated files, including RawTriangleData.hs.
