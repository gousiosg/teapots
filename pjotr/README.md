Scheme
=======

The main file is tri.scm. It is pre-processed by an R7RS-compliant
SYNTAX-RULES expander into tria.scm, which is loaded into Hop
server-side (see tria.wiki).

Alternatively, one can use tri-test.scm to generate just the <DIV>s.

Generated teapot-right.xhtml and Mozilla rendered teapot-right.png
are included as well.
