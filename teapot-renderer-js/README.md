Teapot-renderer-js
=======

You can open up the index.html file using your browser. Simple copy paste the input values found in teapot.txt in the textarea and click the render button. You can optionally check the 'randomize colors' checkbox to render the teapot with random colors.

In order to use common functional programming functions like: map, fold, each, etc. we've added a library called prelude JS, which provides these and many other functions.

We've also included a test suite we constructed when making this assignment. It uses Jasmine for Behaviour Driven Development. In order to run the tests you can open the SpecRunner.html file in your browser.
